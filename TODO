Recommendations

By implementing these improvements, you can significantly enhance the code quality and structure of your project. Let me know if you'd like help with any specific aspect!

1. Enhance Documentation:

Add docstrings for all functions, classes, and modules. Include explanations for parameters, return values, and exceptions.

2. Refactor Large Classes:

Break down classes like TaskDetailEditor into smaller, more focused components.
Introduce Constants and Enums:

Replace hardcoded values with constants or enums to reduce errors and improve readability.


3. Implement Tests:

Add unit tests for database interactions, UI logic, and utility methods. Use a testing framework like pytest.

4.Optimize Error Handling:

Replace print statements with proper logging and informative error messages.

5. Abstract Repeated Patterns:

Create utility functions or classes for tasks like event binding or time handling.

6.Use Linting Tools:

Use tools like pylint or flake8 to enforce code quality standards.

7. Modularize Main Application Code:

Split the application setup in ttplus.py into separate modules for better organization and scalability.
